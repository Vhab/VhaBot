INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AND STARTING UP THE BOT APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST .NET 2.0 PRIOR TO RUNNING THE APPLICATION.  

Once you have the bot in the location you will run it from, run Configure.exe
and input all values, also checking "Enable" to enable the bot.

File -> Save then you may Exit the Configure application.

Run Vhabot.exe


TROUBLESHOOTING

If the error about port problems arises, simply change the port in the config.xml file
while the Vhabot application is closed. Restart Vhabot.exe. If it continues, change the
port but restart the computer afterwards to clean up any ports having communication.
